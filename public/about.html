<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I'm a math graduate. I love tech. I was always interested in knowing how
  websites and apps work. The world of internet always fasinated me. Being from
  a middle class family in India, nobody actually understood what I wanted to
  do. So this is where I'm. I'm a Web developer. Sort of. As of now, I only know
  HTML. But I will be a professional soon and will be so good that you will not
  be able to ignore me.
